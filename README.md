Info
----

A zip library for rust which supports reading and writing of simple ZIP files.

Supported compression formats:

* stored (i.e. none)
* deflate
* bzip2

Currently unsupported zip extensions:

* Encryption
* Multi-disk

Usage
-----

With all default features:

```toml
[dependencies]
zip = "0.5"
```

Without the default features:

```toml
[dependencies]
zip = { version = "0.5", default-features = false }
```

The features available are:

* `deflate`: Enables the deflate compression algorithm, which is the default for zipfiles
* `bzip2`: Enables the BZip2 compression algorithm.
* `time`: Enables features using the [time](https://github.com/rust-lang-deprecated/time) crate.

All of these are enabled by default.

MSRV
----

Our current Minimum Supported Rust Version is **1.34.0**. When adding features,
we will follow these guidelines:

- We will always support the latest four minor Rust versions. This gives you a 6
  month window to upgrade your compiler.
- Any change to the MSRV will be accompanied with a **minor** version bump
   - While the crate is pre-1.0, this will be a change to the PATCH version.

Examples
--------

   * How to write a directory of files to a zip (using [walkdir](https://github.com/BurntSushi/walkdir)).
   * How to extract a zip file.
   * How to extract a single file from a zip.
   * How to read a zip from the standard input.
